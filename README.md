# 💻 | DISCOUNT CALCULATOR

Hello! 😁

This project is based on a calculator that helps you to know the total cost of something to which a discount is applied.

You can choose the amount and the discount you want and the calculator will tell you the final price.

Also, for it to work you have to fill in both fields and you can't select a discount >= 100% or it will throw an error message. Try it yourself.

What do you think? You can leave me your comments via email:
